      <title>Custom delete policy</title>

      <description>Do you have a recurring job that triggers every 5 minutes and only does a small check to see whether something needs to be processed? 95% of the time there is probably nothing to do and the job succeeds immediately. But, all these recurring jobs fill up your JobRunr Dashboard (a huge amount of succeeded and deleted jobs) and also fill up your database.
JobRunr already allows you to configure the deletion policy for all jobs in the JobRunr configuration.</description>

      <title>Database Fault Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/database-fault-tolerance/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/database-fault-tolerance/</guid>
      <description>JobRunr by defaults stops completely if my SQL / NoSQL database goes down and there is a reason for this - JobRunr namely uses your database for a lot of things:
 Master node election for the BackgroundJobServer Fetching the details of a Job and update the state when it&amp;rsquo;s done Monitoring whether there are no zombie jobs (jobs that were being processed on a BackgroundJobServer node that crashed) Optimistic locking so that a job will be only executed once &amp;hellip;  The moment JobRunr loses itâ€™s connection to the database (or the database goes down), there will be a lot of threads that will try to read and write updates to the database but all of these will off-course fail.</description>

      <title>Job Result</title>

      <description>If your job returns a result, JobRunr serializes it and stores it via the StorageProvider in the database of your choice.
You can then fetch the result of that job using the id of the job.
  void startWeatherPrediction(UUID cityId) {  Observation observation = observationService.getLatestObservation(cityId); // the original observation  BackgroundJob.enqueue(myId, () -&amp;gt; weatherService.predictWeather(cityId, observation)); }  WeatherPrediction getWeatherPrediction(UUID cityId) {  JobResultWithBackOffInfo jobResult = BackgroundJob.getJobResult(jobId);  if(jobResult.</description>

      <title>Replacing jobs</title>

      <guid>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/replace-jobs/</guid>
      <description>Do you need to replace an already enqueued job? Or a job that is already being processed? Thanks to the JobRunr Pro enqueueOrReplace and scheduleOrReplace you can update the existing job easily.
 UUID cityId = city.getId(); Observation observation = observationService.getLatestObservation(cityId); // the original observation BackgroundJob.enqueue(myId, () -&amp;gt; weatherService.predictWeather(cityId, observation));  Observation observation = observationService.getLatestObservation(cityId); // the updated observation after a storm BackgroundJob.enqueueOrReplace(myId, () -&amp;gt; weatherService.predictWeather(cityId, observation)); This replaces the existing background job as it uses the same uuid to create the job.</description>

      <title>Batches</title>

      <description>Batches allow you to create a bunch of background jobs atomically. This means that if there was an exception during the creation of background jobs, none of them will be processed. Consider you want to send 1000 emails to your clients, and they really want to receive these emails. Here is the old way:
public class NewsletterService {   @Inject  private UserRepository userRepository;   public void sendEmailsToAllSubscribers() {  List&amp;lt;User&amp;gt; users = userRepository.</description>

      <description>Prevent JobNotFoundExceptions thanks to the JobRegressionGuard Are you applying some of Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s tips and tricks from his great book Clean Code? It probably also means you&amp;rsquo;re sometimes refactoring&amp;hellip; but what about your existing jobs in production? Won&amp;rsquo;t they break? Will you know if they break?
JobRunr Pro has you covered thanks to the JobRegressionGuard:
 @Test void validateExistingJobs() {  JobRegressionGuard jobRegressionGuard = new JobRegressionGuard();  jobRegressionGuard.validateJobs(&amp;#34;&amp;lt;url to your staging/production dashboard&amp;gt;&amp;#34;); } This simple unit test will notify you if you did some refactorings that are not compatible with the jobs in production.</description>

      <guid>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/job-chaining/</guid>
      <description>JobRunr Pro allows you to chain jobs using a fluent API style. This gives you an immediate overview of your business process.
 @Inject private ArchiveService archiveService; @Inject private NotifyService notifyService;  public void createArchiveAndNotify(String folder) {  BackgroundJob  .enqueue(() -&amp;gt; archiveService.createArchive(folder))  .continueWith(() -&amp;gt; notifyService.notifyViaSlack(&amp;#34;ops-team&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;The following folder was archived: &amp;#34; + folder)) }  The notification will only be send once the archive was created successfully (and thus the archiveService.</description>

      <title>Job Filters</title>

      <guid>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/job-filters/</guid>
      <description>A Job Filter can be used to extend the functionality of JobRunr with extra business processes when a job succeeds or fails. They also exist in the free version but in the Pro version integration is a lot easier as any Spring / Micronaut / Quarkus Bean can become a Job Filter.
Usage To create a Job Filter, just implement a bean with the interface JobClientFilter or JobServerFilter.
 @Component public class NotifyJobCreatedFilter implements JobClientFilter, JobServerFilter {   private SlackNotificationService slackNotificationService;   public NotifyJobCreatedFilter(SlackNotificationService slackNotificationService) {  this.</description>

      <description>Job search Are you processing millions of jobs? Do you need to find that one job and find out if it succeeded? JobRunr Pro has you covered - thanks to a new feature called Job Search.
 Thanks to job filters, you can quickly find the job you are interested in.   Note that users using Redis as StorageProvider can only filter on State, Job Signature, Queue and ServerTag.</description>

      <title>Mutexes</title>

      <guid>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/mutexes/</guid>
      <description>A mutex is a mutually exclusive flag. It acts as a gate keeper to a resource allowing only one Job to use it and postpones all others jobs using the same mutex is free.
Usage Using a mutex is as easy as using Queues and Server Tags, again thanks to the Job annotation. Just add it to your service method and specify the mutex to use
 @Job(mutex = &amp;#34;virus-scanner&amp;#34;) public void onlyProcessOneJobAtTheSameTime() {  System.</description>

      <guid>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/queues/</guid>
      <description>Are you processing millions of jobs? Do you have some high-prio jobs that need to finish fast? Use JobRunr queues to make sure that critical jobs cut in front of already enqueued jobs.
Usage Using queues could not have been easier thanks to the Job annotation. Just add it to your service method and specify on which queue you want to run it.
public static final String HighPrioQueue = &amp;#34;high-prio&amp;#34;; public static final String DefaultQueue = &amp;#34;default&amp;#34;; public static final String LowPrioQueue = &amp;#34;low-prio&amp;#34;;  public void runJobs() {  BackgroundJob.</description>

      <title>Server Tags</title>
      <link>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/server-tags/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 11:12:23 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/server-tags/</guid>
      <description>Do you have some jobs that can only be run on certain servers (e.g. jobs tied to a specific OS like Linux, Max and Windows)? Or do you want to run a job only on the server that created the job? JobRunr has you covered with Server Tags!
A BackgroundJobServer can have multiple server tags and a job can specify only one server tag via the Job annotation. If the server tag of the job matches any of the server tags of the server, the server is eligible to run the job.</description>

      <title>Transaction plugin</title>
      <link>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/transactions/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 11:12:23 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/transactions/</guid>
      <description>The JobRunr Spring Boot Starter and Micronaut integration come with an @Transactional plugin that makes sure your jobs join the transaction created by the framework.
 @Inject private UserRepository userRepositoy; @Inject private JobScheduler jobScheduler;  @Transactional public void createUserAndSendWelcomeEmail(User user) {  userRepositoy.save(user);  jobScheduler.&amp;lt;UserService&amp;gt;enqueue(x -&amp;gt; x.sendWelcomeEmail(user.id)); }  Thanks to the @Transactional support, the whole method - including the job scheduling - is transactional.
  How does it work?</description>
